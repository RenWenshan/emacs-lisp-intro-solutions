;; Chapter 8: Cutting and Storing Text
;; ===================================

;; Exercise 1
;; ----------
;;
;; Question:
;; Write an interactive function that searches for a string.  If the search
;; finds the string, leave point after it and display a message that says
;; "Found!".  (Do not use `search-forward' for the name of this function; if you
;; do, you will overwrite the existing version of `search-forward' that comes
;; with Emacs.  Use a name such as `test-search' instead.)
;;
;; Solution:
(defun wenshan-test-search (string)
  "Search current buffer for STRING and display `Found!' if succeed."
  (interactive
   ;; read in `string-to-search'
   (list (read-string "Search: ")))
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (when (search-forward string)
    (message "Found!")))
