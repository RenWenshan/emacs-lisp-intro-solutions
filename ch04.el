;; Chapter 4: A Few Buffer-Related Functions
;; =========================================

;; Exercise 1
;; ----------
;;
;; Question:
;; Write your own `simplified-end-of-buffer' function definition; then test it
;; to see whether it works.
;;
;; Solution:
(defun wenshan-simplified-end-of-buffer ()
  "Move point to the end of current buffer;
leave mark at previous position."
  (interactive)
  (push-mark)
  (goto-char (point-max)))


;; Exercise 2
;; ----------
;;
;; Question:
;; Use `if' and `get-buffer' to write a function that prints a message telling
;; you whether a buffer exists.
;;
;; Solution:
(defun wenshan-buffer-exists-p (buffer)
  "Check if BUFFER exists."
  (interactive
   (list (read-buffer "Buffer name: " (other-buffer
                                       (current-buffer) t))))
  (if (get-buffer buffer)
      (message "Buffer `%s' exists" buffer)
    (message "Buffer `%s' does not exist" buffer)))


;; Exercise 3
;; ----------
;;
;; Question:
;; Using `find-tag', find the source for the `copy-to-buffer' function.
;;
;; Solution: press "M-. copy-to-buffer RET", then choose the appropriate TAGS file
