;; Chapter 5: A Few More Complex Functions
;; =======================================

;; Exercise 1
;; ----------
;;
;; Question:
;; Write an interactive function with an optional argument that tests whether
;; its argument, a number, is greater than or equal to, or else, less than the
;; value of `fill-column', and tells you which, in a message.  However, if you
;; do not pass an argument to the function, use 56 as a default value.
;;
;; Solution: press "C-u NUM M-x wenshan-compare-with-fill-column"
(defun wenshan-compare-with-fill-column (&optional num)
  "Compare prefix arg NUM with `fill-column'."
  (interactive "P")
  (setq num (if num (prefix-numeric-value num) 56))
  (if (>= num fill-column)
      (message "%d is greater than or eqaul to `fill-column'" num)
    (message "%d is less than `fill-column'" num)))
